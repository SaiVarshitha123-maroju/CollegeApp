## Introduction

BrightPath aims to unify and simplify the way students and faculty interact with educational resources and administrative processes. By consolidating notices, assignments, grades, galleries, and communication into one platform, BrightPath fosters a connected and organized school environment.

---

## Motivation

Educational institutions often struggle with fragmented systems that hinder effective communication and resource management. BrightPath was developed to address these challenges by providing a centralized, easy-to-use digital platform to improve access to school resources, streamline communication, and enhance administrative workflows.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite numerous educational tools, schools face difficulties in managing student-teacher interactions, educational materials, and administrative tasks due to scattered and complex systems. There is a pressing need for an integrated, role-based platform that provides both students and faculty with efficient access and management of school resources and communication channels.

- **Gallery Viewing**: Interactive school event galleries for students and faculty.
- **Assignment Management**: Faculty upload assignments and set deadlines; students can download and submit assignments.
- **Marks Issuance**: Faculty can input and track student grades across semesters.
- **Personalized User Profiles**: Students and faculty can update academic and contact information.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure, role-specific feature access.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization**: Instant updates via Firebase backend, including offline support.
- **Notification & Reminder System**: Push notifications and event-driven reminders for important updates.

## Algorithms and Models

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Ensures users access only relevant features based on their role (student or faculty).
- UI adapts dynamically according to user permissions.

### 2. Data Synchronization
- Real-time syncing of data (notices, assignments) between client and Firebase backend.
- Offline access via local caching.

### 3. Notification and Reminder System
- Real-time push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- Event-driven reminders for deadlines and exams.

## Existing Systems

BrightPath differentiates itself from existing platforms like:

- **Google Classroom** â€” Limited to class and assignment management.
- **Moodle** â€” Strong course management but lacks broader school-wide administrative tasks.
- **Remind** â€” Focuses on communication without academic management features.
- **Schoology** â€” Comprehensive academic tools but lacks streamlined school-wide notices.
- **Edmodo** â€” Classroom management with limited integration of school resources.
- **PowerSchool** â€” Academic tracking with minimal access to non-academic school resources.

BrightPath offers an all-in-one, user-friendly platform consolidating academic management, communication, and resource access.
